Module 6 Assignment
Author: Mark Wireman

# Description
Extract data from the NASA API, specifically from two sources—its GST data and its CME data—then merge the data together and compute the average time it takes for a CME to cause a GST. Later, this data can be used with Machine Learning models to create predictions.

# Pre-requisite
1. NASA API KEY - Obtain the key <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">here</a>.
2. Modify the my.env file and add the API key.
3. Review the <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/">API for DONKI CME and GST</a> documentation to understand usage and output.

# Outcome
Compute the mean and median time that it takes for a CME to cause a GST.

# Execution
1. Clone the repository.
2. Modify the my.env file to add your NASA API KEY
3. Run the file retrieve_data.ipynb using the Jupyter console or the Jupyter terminal command.
